# mdconf

  Markdown driven configuration!

  Using the fantastic markdown parser [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).

## Installation

```
$ npm install mdconf
```

## API

```js
var parse = require('mdconf');
parse('string of markdown');
// => Object
```

## Example

Markdown headings act as keys, list items with `:` act as maps,
otherwise regular lists behave as.. lists.

```markdown
# Defaults

  Since this is markdown you can still have regular text
  to explain what the hell is going on.

  - dir: /tmp

  "defaults": {
    "upload": {
      "max": "200mb",
      "dir": "/tmp",
      "thumbnail sizes": [
        "50x50",
        "300x300",
        "600x600",
        "900x900"
      ]
    },
    "s3": {
      "api key": "111111",
      "secret": "222222",
      "buckets": {
        "avatars": "myapp-avatars",
        "assets": "myapp-assets",
        "files": "myapp-files"
      }
    }
  },
  "production": {
    "upload": {
      "max": "1gb",
      "dir": "/data/uploads"
    }
  }
}
```

  With markdown blocks you could easily use this as a tool for
  static site generation:

```md

# Scripts

  My site does almost nothing:

    document.write('<h1>mdconf</h1>')
    document.write('<p>Markdown configuration is pretty cool</p>')

# Styles

  Main structural styling:

    body {
      padding: 50px;
      font: 14px Helvetica;
    }

  Some other stuff:

    button {
      padding: 15px;
    }
```

 yields:

```js
{
  "scripts": [
    "document.write('<h1>mdconf</h1>')\ndocument.write('<p>Markdown configuration is pretty cool</p>')"
  ],
  "styles": {
    "body { padding": "50px;\n  font: 14px Helvetica;\n}",
    "button { padding": "15px;\n}"
  }
}
```
